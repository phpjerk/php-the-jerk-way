1. Getting started

    * The best developers make sure they support the lowest PHP version possible. As of this writing, PHP 5.1 has [1.7% of the market share](http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php/5/all). Out of 1000 people, that would be 170 still using PHP 5.1. Quite a substancial amount.  Therefore, ignore learning anything that won't work using PHP 5.1.  Some say version 5.3 offers many benefits over previous versions of PHP, but those people hate their clients and are sad and pathetic.
    * Getting PHP installed with a MySQL database and Apache server is a pain the ass. If I wanted to be a server admin, I'd grow hair on my back, learn to speak Klingon, and eat Twinkies every day. To get started, just install [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) or [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/index.html), and try to get something around PHP version 5.1.6.
    * Next, get a GoDaddy account and use them to host your sites. I'm pretty sure they're using PHP 5 now, and at like $5/month, you can't beat the price.  Plus, you can use FTP to transfer your files over, so that's handy.
     * If you've never used PHP before, the two best resources to get up-and-running are [WebMonkey](http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/php_tutorial_for_beginners/) and [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp).
     
     
2. Tools

    * Since editing your code is where you spend your most time, it's imperative to use the right tools.  In the past, the most respected web developers used Microsoft FrontPage or Macromedia Dreamweaver.  These days, we just need a simple text editor that comes with your operating system (or 'OS' as the professionals say). On windows, you have Notepad and on Mac, you have TextEdit. On Linux... I don't really know, because I'm pretty sure no one really uses Linux for anything. 
    
    
3. Code Style

    * No one cares. The user will never see your code, so why worry about how it looks to _other_ programmers? Don't worry about spacing, or where braces go, or what's uppercase.  Hell, write everything on a single line if you want.  Seriously... no one gives a shit.
    
    
4. Managing Dependencies 
    * There are two *very* easy ways to include other people's code into your project: 1) Copy and paste it into your file or 2) use the handy `include("somecode.php");` at the top of your file.
